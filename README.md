The editor consists of multiple panes that allow the user to configure all the aspects of the component or page that he/she creates. These include the Content page, which shows the content of the currently selected view, the Details pane, which allows the user to configure the properties of the selected view, the Resources page, which allows the user to add and edit custom .css files in-browser, and the components page, which contains a list all HTML tags the user can use, as well as all of the components the user created (the purpose of these components is to be reused in different pages).
